            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I am currently a third year student at UCSD, majoring in Computer <br/>
            Science and minoring in Design. I am most interested in UI/UX Design <br/>
            and Frontend Development, though I really want to learn about all types <br/>
            of cutting-edge technology. On my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, <br/>
            and art in general.</p>
            <h3>Some Fun Facts About Me</h3>
            <p> &middot; My least favorite programming language is C <br/>
                &middot; My hometown is San Francisco <br/>
                &middot; I love to paint, draw, and make arts & crafts
                &middot; A piece of code that I live by: <br/>
                <code>
                    while(noSuccess) { <br/>
                        tryAgain(); <br/>
                        if(Dead) { <br/>
                        break; <br/>
                        } <br/>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>

            <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>When I was a Senior in High School, I took AP Computer Science, and while I <br/>
                was not great at programming then, I was intrigued by the concept of programming <br/>
                and creating software. I was incredibly hesitant to choose to major in Computer <br/>
                Science, and instead almost majored in Biology. Yet, the excitement I would get <br/>
                when seeing my code compile and run successfully was too much to ignore. I am now <br/>
                dreaming of the day that I can call myself a Computer Scientist.</p>
