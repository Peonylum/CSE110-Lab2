                    <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
                    <p>When I was a Senior in High School, I took AP Computer Science, and while I <br />
                        was not great at programming then, I was intrigued by the concept of programming <br />
                        and creating software. I was incredibly hesitant to choose to major in Computer <br />
                        Science, and instead almost majored in Biology. Yet, the excitement I would get <br />
                        when seeing my code compile and run successfully was too much to ignore. <br />
                        <br />
                        Ever since I have learned more in-depth concepts and practices about Computer Science <br />
                        here at UCSD, I have developed a vague sense of what I want to do as a career. Though <br />
                        I have grown a liking to UI/UX Design and frontend development, I still want to learn <br />
                        more about backend development and API development. It would be a great honor to become <br />
                        a full-stack developer eventually.
